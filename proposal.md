# Software Project Proposal

* WeStudy is a platform that allows students to create or join study groups at anytime with ease. There is no longer a need to send emails to classmates asking if anyone is interested in forming a study group at the beginning of the semester—just search by course name and you will see all the active groups, or simply create a new one if none is available. Members in a study group can schedule on-campus meetings regularly, share notes and other study materials, discuss course materials with each other in the group’s online chat room, etc. Users can also see all upcoming study group meetings nearby on the map based on the current location.

* The project will include membership management, file uploading and downloading module, map API, implementation of real-time chatting and other features, which I believe will be reasonable amount of work for a group of 4 or 5 developers to complete in one semester.
